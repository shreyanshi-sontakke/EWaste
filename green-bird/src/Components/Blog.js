            <p className="blogp">Garbage disposal is a concerning problem that directly harms our environment. It already threatens mankind with air pollution carrying respiratory diseases or contaminated water bodies affecting the ecosystem.
                <br/><br/>However, In the recent decades of technology and information boom we are faced with a graver problem.
                With internet came the global euphoria over the potential of a new body of technologies lumped under it.
                <br/><br/>These technologies diffused rapidly in the modern global economy. With business on the internet, people’s infatuation with buying the ‘latest’ products and shorter product life e-waste has seen a steep increase in the past decade.
                In developing country such as Africa and India, e-waste from developed countries finds an easy-way in the name of free trade.
                Referencing the e-waste management in developing countries, a 2020 UN report claims
                “E-waste management infrastructure is not yet fully developed or in some cases, entirely absent”
                <br/><br/>The global e-waste monitor 2020 report found that In 2020 the world dumped a record 53.6 million metric tons of e-waste. And only 17.4% was recycled. The number grows. It is also worthwhile to mention that a lot of unusable gadgets simply pile at home. UK produces about 20Kg e-waste/person/year.
                UK is a long shot.
                Personally, I have an outdated fridge, a washing machine sitting in the garage with many other unaccounted little gadgets.
                But why so much fuss over e-waste?
                <br/><br/>E-waste like phones contain elements like gold, iron, lead, copper, silicone and many other hazardous elements. <br/>How do they harm us?
                As mentioned, electronic waste contains toxic components that are dangerous to human health.
                <br/><br/>The negative health effects of these toxins on humans include brain, heart, liver, kidney and skeletal system damage.<br/> It can also considerably affect the nervous and reproductive systems of the human body, leading to disease and birth defects.<br/><br/> Improper disposal of e-waste is unbelievably dangerous to the global environment,
                 which is why it is so important to spread awareness on this growing problem and the threatening aftermath.
                 <br/><br/> To avoid these toxic effects of e-waste, it is crucial to properly e-cycle, so that items can be recycled, refurbished, resold, or reused.
                 <br/><br/> The growing stream of e-waste will only worsen if not educated on the correct measures of disposal.

                <br/><br/>The problem is unsettling, if persistent, wall-e days are not far.
                <br/><br/>In an effort to start solving the problem we propose GreenBird.
                GreenBird helps you connect to your local e-waste collector who will help you make a positive impact on the environment.
                To search for your local collectors, it fetches data from rest API’s and helps you connect. You might want to take a look at the cities covered by GreenBird.
                If you are an e-waste collector you can join the platform and help reach people in your city. The data fed by the collectors is stored in IBM Cloudant. As you might tell, greenbird is still in baby stages of development.
                <br/><br/>
                Today it is key to find a proper way to dispose your e-waste, but to begin, It needs a proper place
